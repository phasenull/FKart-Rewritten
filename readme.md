### FKart - Open-source public transit app by people, for people
### !!! AS OF APRIL 10th THIS PROJECT IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS !!!
FKart is a project that focuses on building a better public transit app mainly for Kocaeli (also supports [other 23 cities](https://service.kentkart.com/rl1/api/city))
Kocaeli itself has an official public app (3 of them actually), but they were so bad and unstable that i thought "hey, this should not even be available to public (update 10/05/2024: seems like google took down one of them lol), someone should make a better one" so i started this project.

As far as i know, the company responsible for public transit infrastructure [Ulaşım Park](https://www.ulasimpark.com.tr/) does not have its own services and using [KentKart](https://www.kentkart.com/),
they don't have a public docs for their API and thats pretty much what makes this project hard, even if they did it wouldn't matter since their backend is so unorganized :) that they should probably create a new one from scratch.

### Resources used:
All the data and API endpoints on this project were found using reverse-engineering and long hours of inspecting network traffic on browser and i still don't know much about their services, i dont know what im doing and neither do they.
